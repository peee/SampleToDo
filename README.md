# Sample To-Do App with Kotlin and Android architecture components

This is a sample to-do app that is a practice to use Kotlin
and Android architecture components. Currently work in progress.

## Features Implemented

* Add, update, and delete to-do items
  * Click on To-Do item to open edit dialog
  * Long-click on To-Do item to open delete confirmation
* Due date optionally per item
* Reminder (notification) optionally per item
  * Due date is required


## Future Plan

* Accessing DB on non-main thread
* Decorating UI for better look and feel
* Utilizing other archtecture components than `Room`
  * `Lifecycle`, `ViewModel`, `LiveData`
* Better handling for done/delete
